## How to use?

All items in the **Chat-bot Security Checklist** are must for majority of the projects.exception can only be made for regulatory reason. you can use this checklist to implement three layered defense your Chatbot product. I devided this security impact of each class in three Low, Medium, and High.

* ![Low][low_img] means that the item is **recommended** but can be omitted in some particular situations.
* ![Medium][medium_img] means that the item is **highly recommended** and can eventually be omitted in some really particular cases. Some elements, if omitted, can have bad repercussions.
* ![High][high_img] means that the item **can't be omitted** by any reason. You may leave a huge vulnerability open to the world. The testing priority needs to be on these elements first.
